   <h1>Everything You Need To Know About CSS Margins</br><em><small>by Racheal Andrew</small></em></h1>

   <p>Margins in CSS seem simple enough at first glance. Applied to an element it forms a space around the element, pushing other elements away. However, there is more to a margin than you might think.
</p>
<p>One of the first things most of us learned when we learned CSS, was details of the various parts of a box in CSS, described as The CSS Box Model. One of the elements in the Box Model is the margin, a transparent area around a box, which will push other elements away from the box contents. The margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left properties were described right back in CSS1, along with the shorthand margin for setting all four properties at once.</p>

<h2>Improve Your JavaScript Knowledge By Reading Source Code</br><em><small>by Carl Mungazi</small></em></h2>

<p>When you are still early on in your programming career, digging into the source code of open source libraries and frameworks can be a daunting endeavor. In this article, Carl Mungazi shares how he got over his fear and began using source code to improve his knowledge and skills. He also uses Redux to demonstrate how he approaches breaking down a library.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time you dug deep into the source code of a library or framework you use frequently? For me, that moment came during my first job as a frontend developer three years ago.</p>

<h3>Inspired Design Decisions: Pressing Matters</br><em><small>by Andy Clarke</small></em></h3>
<p>As I’d always been at the top of my class during high school, I headed to art college full of confidence that one day I’d be an accomplished painter. This over-confidence didn’t last long though, because when I arrived, I found myself surrounded by conceptual artists, filmmakers, painters, performance artists, printmakers, and sculptors, who all seemed much more talented than I was.</p>

<p>This was especially true of my friend Ben, a gifted painter who went to his studio late every night to work on several large canvases. Ben’s paintings had incredible depth because he built up hundreds of subtle layers of paint over several months.</p>
